As can be easily noticed, a lot of code is prepared and I fill in pieces of code relating to the topics of the lessons. Since I don't code the whole projects, I refrain from claiming complete ownership over these projects. However, I understand the code and the concepts and can use my understanding to work on new problems and to extend my knowledge.
